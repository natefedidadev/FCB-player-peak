# FCB-player-peak
A tactical analysis project for the F.C. Barcelona "More than a Hack" competition

##HOW TO LOAD THE DATA:

1. Download all the data from the drive (dataset_only_tracking_and_events). Do not download the pl3container files as those are heavy and are only used for looking at games in metrica. Only download the masculi folder

2. Drag the masculi folder into the root directory for the repo and rename it to "matches"

3. Now in data_exploration.ipynb, you can select a match from 0 - 10 and examine the data
