The players struggled to maintain compactness, allowing Milan to exploit gaps and create high-quality chances, especially in the final third. \n\nAdditionally, the inability to effectively track runs into the box led to several instances where opponents found space for shots or crosses. Coaches should emphasize improving defensive anticipation during transitions and ensuring players maintain tight marking protocols when under pressure, particularly in crucial areas of the pitch like the defensive third and around set-piece situations. This includes reinforcing communication and maintaining a collective defensive line to prevent opponents from exploiting these vulnerabilities."
