With the nearest defender to the ball being at a distance of 0.35 units, it indicates a moderate separation that could allow for quicker offensive actions from Milan without immediate pressure. The coaching staff should focus on tightening the defensive shape to ensure better coverage and quicker responses during transitions, as the current setup does not facilitate effective pressure on the ball carrier."

The nearest defender was relatively close at a distance of 0.12, indicating a moderate defensive proximity, yet with defenders outnumbered, there was a clear numerical disadvantage near the ball. To mitigate similar risks, coaching staff should emphasize the importance of maintaining defensive shape and readiness to transition effectively when possession is lost.
